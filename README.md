# Hackitect
Fork of Mozilla's "Hax" Template, originally authored by Potch. Hackitect is rethemed styleisticly and functionally, as Hax's original purpose was a blogging-only theme.

## License
  
Hax was originally released under the 'MIT' license, however, this fork is released under the GNU GPLv3 or later, which is compatible with the MIT. I relicensed my forked version due to the fact that WordPress is GNU GPLv2 or later, and the GPL requires deriverative works (such as a theme) to be licensed under the same terms.
  
This theme contains several Mozilla-owned and possibly trademarked graphics. These will be removed, and it is not my intention to use them.
